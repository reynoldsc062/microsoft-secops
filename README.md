# Microsoft SecOps Portfolio

Focused on Microsoft Sentinel & Microsoft Defender XDR - triage, scoping, detection thinking, and KQL hunts used in SOC operations.

This repository is intentionally **operations-first** (how I investigate, tune, and communicate), not code-heavy and not red-team content.

## What you'll find here
- **Hunting (KQL):** queries I use to identify and scope suspicious activity
- **Detection thinking:** what should alert, why, and how to reduce noise
- **Incident writeups:** sanitized notes focused on decisions, impact, and lessons learned
- **Runbooks:** repeatable triage steps for common SOC scenarios
- **Metrics:** practical measures for SOC health (volume, triage time, recurring drivers)

## Roadmap (near-term)
- Add first hunt with operational notes
- Add one runbook (phishing triage)
- Add one incident writeup (sanitized)

## Sanitization
All content is sanitized. Any identifiers, domains, user/device names, and IDs are placeholders.
